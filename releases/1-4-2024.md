Hi Qlik enthusiats!

I wanted to share a tip on how to insert data into a charts. 

Please note that I am using the tip already shared by Steve Dark on his blog post Send Data from the Qlik Load Script 
link - https://www.quickintelligence.co.uk/send-data-from-qlik-load-script/

In the blog post, Steve already explained and shared the script that was used in creating the HTML file with dynamic records from the load script editor in Qlik Sense. He further shared out the html can then be attached and sent via email through the Qlik Web Connector. 

The tip or method can be used on the Qlik Sense desktop or Qlik Sense Enterprise. 

After being able to use the method to send some quick daily reports to clients that require the simple table report at a certain time of each week day. I began to wonder if it were possible to replicate the same HTML file but with charts or images this time around. I lst paragraph of Steve's blog and noticed that Hector Munoz had been able to pass data into a site called image charts (open source), to generate a chart. So I decided to do some reading and testing out image charts site works. 

Studying the html output URL, I notice there were two or three major areas where one could be able to dynamically insert data in the load script and save to an HTML file. Internet is required because the data is passed over to the image charts API and then generates the image chart.

I will leave my code snippet below.
